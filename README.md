# Detection-of-Malicious-Social-Bots-in-Twitter

In order to counter the rising threat of harmful social bots within Twitter networks, this research study introduces a unique technique called the Learning Automata-based harmful Social Bot Detection (LA-MSBD) algorithm. In contrast to conventional techniques that depend on social graph-based characteristics, our suggested algorithm makes use of URL-based features to achieve effective and efficient identification. Through the examination of traits like URL redirection, shared URL frequency, and the existence of spam material inside URLs, our method provides a quick way to differentiate between malicious and genuine tweets with the least amount of computational cost. Most importantly, adding a trust computation model strengthens the algorithm's defenses against sophisticated bot assaults by improving its capacity to recognize reliable users inside the network. Additionally, the system uses Dempster-Shafer theory and Bayesian learning to assess each tweet's trustworthiness, offering a strong framework for identifying and thwarting fraudulent activity. Our study shows the effectiveness of integrating a trust model with URL-based characteristics through rigorous design and assessment, providing a potential path to improve the security and integrity of online social networks against the ubiquitous danger of social bots.
